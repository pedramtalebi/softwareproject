#### Vision:
When an obstacle occurs today, the traffic leader informs the affected bus drivers using radio communication. This - however - is rather messy in practice, due to language barriers and knowledge about the surrounding environment. Bus drivers more than often forget the names of the roads, or where the rerouting takes place, due to the information being received vocally; and often several minutes before it is relevant. Therefore, there is a need to relay this information in a better way.

Our product will provide both the traffic leaders and the bus drivers with an elegant solution to this problem. The product will relay the information from the traffic leaders to the bus drivers in a visual manner, and only when the information is actually relevant. For example, the bus drivers will only receive visual information when the bus is in a certain range of the affected area. The bus drivers will interact as little as possible with any of the information when the bus is moving, due to safety.
